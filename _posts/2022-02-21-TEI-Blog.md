**_Introduction_** 

In class, we used the Text Encoding Initiative or, for short, TEI, to encode “Dracula’s Guest” by Bram Stoker, an excerpt from his original novel, Dracula. “Dracula’s Guest'' is a short story about an Englishman who is traveling through the German countryside to an abandoned village on the worst night of the year, “Walpurgis-Nacht.” Everyone in class was given a section of “Dracula’s Guest” to code. My section is about an Englishman traveling with a coachman through the countryside. The horses are acting suspicious and the coachman keeps getting more and more frightened. The coachman stops and lets the Englishman go on his own once the Englishman sees a road he wants to go down. 

**_Google Docs_**

We were given a portion of the text in a google doc and a list of tags to code. There were tags for notes, quotes, paragraph beginning and endings, etc, although not every tag given to us was used. We did not immediately add the tags into the text. Instead, we first commented on where tags would be placed. The comments I placed in the google doc were for paragraph beginnings and endings, quotes, notes, and em-dashes, with the majority being paragraph tags.

**_Oxygen XML_**

We had to use a program called Oxygen XML in order to use TEI. I thoroughly enjoyed using Oxygen XML. It took a little bit to get used to how some tags work. If a tag was messed up in Oxygen, the entire section with that tag would light up red, letting you know it was wrong. There were some sections that would light up red, and I had no idea why it was wrong. When a section lit up red, Oxygen had marks on the side of the page that would let you know which line was wrong.  

In Oxygen, tags look different from what you might think and can be a little confusing. For example, a paragraph has two tags; a beginning tag and a closing tag. A paragraph beginning tag would look like```<p>```, and a paragraph ending tag looks like ```</p>```. If you do not close your tag, the text will light up red. One thing that was cool about my section of “Dracula’s Guest” was that I had a note tag. The note tag I had defined “Walpurgis-Nacht” for the reader.  

The tag I had the most problem with was the em-dash. I wanted to find out why on my own, but I had to cave in and ask for help. I thought when I put the tag in for an em-dash I did it right, but it came up red. I was confused why, and my professor told me I had to remove some of the information that I was putting with the tag. Overall Oxygen took almost a full class to get the hang of, but I did not get frustrated. After a little bit of playing around with text in Oxygen, it is really easy to add code.

**_Closing Thoughts_**

I took a coding class in high school, so when I heard that we were coding my heart sank. I was not a fan of coding in high school, but Oxygen XML was nothing like what I had done before. I came into this project thinking this is not going to be fun, but I actually enjoyed using it. Oxygen was really easy to use after I got the hang of it. As much as I hate to say it, this was a really fun project that makes me want to code more.
