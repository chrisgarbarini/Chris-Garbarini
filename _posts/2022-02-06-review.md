# **_Overview_** 

The Bloodaxe Archives is an interactive poetry project that allows visitors to look up poems, books, and other resources. The Bloodaxe Archives has around 4500 items cataloged and over a thousand items digitally scanned. Every poem or book that is cataloged or digitally scanned is done so with permission from the author. The project allows visitors to not only click on and view books and poetry, but also allows users to access five other interactive icons: shapes, resources, gallery, data and words. The project also has headers that allow you the opportunity to read about the Bloodaxe Archives. The headers are an “about” header, “read about education” header, “credits” header, and a “copyright” header. You can click on each header and read information related to that particular header. You can start by clicking on the icons, or you can scroll down to the “about” header, which details what each interactive icon has to offer.

## **_Credits_**  

The Bloodaxe Archives was created by Tom Scofiled and has contributions from Mitchell Whitelaw. The Bloodaxe Archives has been funded by the “Arts and Humanities Research Council.” The project team consisted of sixteen individuals, including professors. Additionally, four individuals contributed to an international advisory group.

### **_Headers_** 

All of the header sections are very well organized. Each section describes what the header is. The project uses a lot of markdown links. Each section has a markdown, such as a contact us markdown under the “credit” header, or a take down policy under the “copyright” header.  One section that was perfect was the “copyright” section. The copyright section lists exactly what you can and cannot do with the project. It describes how the project is intended for non commercial use only. Every markdown link that was available under each header worked and took you to the correct location.

#### **_Interactivity_**

The project's interactivity is great. The Bloodaxe Archives is very easy to navigate, and if a visitor needs help, everything is explained well in each section. The first thing you see in the Bloodaxe Archives is a big icon, with five smaller icons surrounding it. This is where people can hover over each icon to find out what it leads to. The biggest icon leads to books, while the others lead to galleries, resources, data, shapes, and words. The interactivity of the project was perfect and every icon took to where it was supposed to take you. This interactive tool is a fun and easy way for people to look up books and poems and other resources related to the topic they are searching.

##### **_Critique_**

Although the Bloodaxe Archives is a very easy and appealing interactive tool, it has some problems. All of the headers should be the same size. Copyright, education, and credits are all the same size, but the “about” header is smaller. The project title can also be hard to see for me. This has to do with the font color, and the background color of the website. The project also has weird shapes and lines in the background. These shapes and lines do not make any sense to me. There is a rectangular box outlined in the top right corner for no reason. There are always words like “Conn” and “Page” in the background that also make no sense to me. I think the shapes, lines, and words in the background that do not relate to the project should be removed.

###### **_Findings_** 

The project has a few small problems that need to be fixed, but there are no major problems with the project. Everything is explained well. The interactive feature is super easy to use and navigate. Every markdown link and interactive tool the project has to offer works as it should. Overall, I like the simplistic background, and it fits the project well. This project is something that I can see myself using because of the interactivity and the simplicity of the project.
