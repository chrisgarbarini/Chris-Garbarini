**Introduction**

I had no idea what to expect coming into Digital Humanities. I took this class to fulfill a writing intensive requirement. With that being said, this class has turned out to be a very enjoyable class. The first day of class made it seem like it was going to be a long semester. Going through the assignments talking about coding and making blogs made it seem like I was going to be in over my head during this class. All was good though, none of the assignments were too hard, but some were a little long. This class has taught me some new skills and writing tactics that will be beneficial to me in the future. This class also taught me that digital humanities are everywhere in our daily life without us realizing. There was one tool that really bennefited me during this class was the course wesbite. The course website had all the information I needed, and I was alwasy able to access it. 

 


  
**Skills Learned**

One of the skills that I learned in this class was Oxygen.XML. Oxygen.XML is a coding software that we used for the TEI blog. Learning how to code was really cool. I did a little bit of coding in high school, but it was nothing like what we did in this class. Another skill I learned was how to use Github. Github was not the most intriguing thing to me when we first went over it in class, but now I see it as a useful tool to convey information. Github also allows users to do so much, like create projects or repositories. These two skills that I picked up in this class may not be skills that I am going to need anytime soon, but could be very useful in the future. I won’t have to learn these skills, and it will give me an edge on my coworkers when the time comes.

**Assignments**

I thoroughly enjoyed most of the assignments that we completed throughout the semester. The assignments I enjoyed most were the TEI blog, review blog, and the grant project. There were some assignments that I didn’t enjoy, like the about me blog and twitter post. 

_TEI Blog_ 

The TEI blog was probably my favorite assignment that we completed this semester. It was very interesting to go through a text passage from “Dracula’s Guest” and then code information, like em-dashes. I had no idea what Oxygen.XML was when we were going over the assignment, but it is a very beneficial tool to know how to use. Seeing how you could input some code for a quote or note was cool to see and learn how to do.

_Review Blog_

The Review blog was also a very interesting assignment. The reason I liked this assignment so much was because we were given a website to go through to critique and analyze. I really like to analyze things, so this assignment was great. I reviewed the Bloodaxe Archives, which is an interactive poetry project. It was cool to see an interactive project for poetry, it seems like there are interactive projects for everything.

_Grant Project_

The grant project was also a cool project. At first, I thought we were actually making the project, so I was a little stressed. It was a long project, where we spent weeks working on it, and I felt a lot of satisfaction from turning it in. Seeing where I started on this project to when I turned in the final draft was surreal and gave me a sense of accomplishment. 

_Twitter Post_

I have nothing against Twitter or the assignment of tweeting twice a week with a reply. My problem with this assignment was, for me, it got boring and repetitive. This primarily happened when we were working on the grant and a lot of classes we would just work, and we would have to tweet about the work. I think that if the posts could have been spread out more, like tweeting every other week, it would have made the assignment better for me.

_About Me Blog_

The problems I had on the About Me blog had nothing to do with the assignment itself, but my frustration with Github. I missed the day in class where we went over how to set up and use Github, so I really struggled completing this assignment. My picture would not show up when the code was right. The assignment was the first of the semester, and I got stressed when I could not figure out Github. 

**Conclusion**

I have found out that this class has made me a better writer and taught me some very useful skills for the future. This class is not a traditional English class. All of the readings that we did before every class gave me a new perspective on my writing. This is a very engaging class and none of the assignments are dull. Everything we did in Digital Humanities was for a purpose, whether that be to prepare us for the next assignment or to improve our writing.
